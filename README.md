# SQSProducer
Send message to SQS

# Description
Simple C# console app to send a message to a defined SQS url.  

# Usage
You will need to set up an AWS SQS.  Copy its URL and add to the queueUrl in the source file (SQSProducer.cs)

You will also need to provide your AWS credentials in the source file SQSProducer.cs (access key, secret key, region). For obvious reasons I cannot put mine in there.
